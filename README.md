# Identifying the most effective machine learning approach for neurosyphilis diagnosis: a multicenter, retrospective study using real-world data to compare diagnostic criteria from four continents
This is the repo for hosting the codes for the article "Identifying the most effective machine learning approach for neurosyphilis diagnosis: a multicenter, retrospective study using real-world data to compare diagnostic criteria from four continents".

We built an online streamlit app at: [link](https://neurosyphilis-prediction.streamlit.app/)

This app supports several diagnosis guildances:

It also shows different aspects of selected model, including shap values, ROC/AUC, Net benefit, and Calibration:
